    "In the lectures we have covered the Hartree-Fock method of finding an approximation to the ground-state energy of the electrons in a molecule.  While it is theoretically possible to solve the relevant equations by hand, this is exceptionally long and tedious.  Instead, we typically use one of the many quantum chemistry packages which have been developed for the purpose of performing this procedure on a computer.  In this problem, we will use the pyscf package for this purpose.  First, we install the package (probably best to do this in a fresh environment):"
